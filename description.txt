Webmilio's Commons Library adds a couple of things I use in all of my mods. You can extract the DLL from the Mod. 

THE 1.4 IS A HEAVY ALPHA THAT HAS NOT BEEN TESTED.
Anything related to Worlds has been disabled.
Had to remove the Network methods for Reading/Writing items since the good people at tMod thought it wise to remove the method ¯\_(^.^)_/¯.

Things this adds:
- Better Networking (in my opinion, at least).
- Managers (manual or singletons that handle classes that could be seen as static, but need inheritance)
- Loaders (manual or singletons that handle loading all found classes within the Terraria assembly, including mods)
- Identity Manager (WIP): a way to get Steam ID from the user (if the user is using Steam)
- A bunch of extensions
- Keyboard Manager: get the state of any keys (NotPressed, JustPressed, Pressed, JustReleased), regardless of Mod Hotkey.
- Custom Achievements: you can add custom achievements in a less complex way than without the library.
- Effects: screenshake (multiplayer compatible), easy shaders
- Math/Vector stuffs: velocity vector to point/mouse, checking if a point is inside a triangle/rectangle (since you can't with normal rectangles)

Other Utilities:
- Class which allows you to quickly create a tile-placing item once extended.

	* Easy shader code cause I suck at doing them

Special Thanks
- Kazzymodus: being a gamer and hand-holding me with shaders until I understood them.

If you want an example mod that uses this better networking, check out the JoJo mod by HellGoesOn on https://github.com/ruskies/TerrarianBizzareAdventure or https://github.com/ruskies/TLoZ and search for ModPlayerNetworkPacket.
