Webmilio's Commons Library adds a couple of things I use in all of my mods. You can extract the DLL from the Mod. 

Things this adds:
- Better Networking (in my opinion, at least).
- Full Managers (manual or singletons that handle classes that could be seen as static, but need inheritance)
- Full Loaders (manual or singletons that handle loading all found classes within the Terraria assembly, including mods)
- Identity Manager (WIP): a way to get Steam ID from the user (if the user is using Steam)
- A bunch of extensions
- Keyboard Manager: get the state of any keys (NotPressed, JustPressed, Pressed, JustReleased), regardless of Mod Hotkey.
- Custom Achievements: you can add custom achievements in a less complex way than without the library.
- Effects: screenshake (multiplayer compatible)

Other Utilities:
- Class which allows you to quickly create a tile-placing item once extended.

- Scalie: ideas for
	* Custom Achievements
	* StandardTileItem

If you want an example mod that uses this better networking, check out the JoJo mod by HellGoesOn on https://github.com/ruskies/TerrarianBizzareAdventure or https://github.com/ruskies/TLoZ and search for ModPlayerNetworkPacket.
