Webmilio's Commons Library adds a couple of things I use in all of my mods. You can extract the DLL from the Mod. 

THE 1.4 IS A HEAVY ALPHA THAT HAS NOT BEEN TESTED.
Anything related to Worlds has been disabled.
Had to remove the Network methods for Reading/Writing items since the good people at tMod thought it wise to remove the method ¯\_(^.^)_/¯.

Things this adds:
- Better Networking (in my opinion, at least).
- Loaders (manual or singletons that handle loading all found classes within the Terraria assembly, including mods)
- A bunch of extensions
- Keyboard Manager: get the state of any keys (NotPressed, JustPressed, Pressed, JustReleased), regardless of Mod Hotkey.
- Effects: screenshake (multiplayer compatible), easy shaders
- Math/Vector stuffs: velocity vector to point/mouse, checking if a point is inside a triangle/rectangle (since you can't with normal rectangles)
- Dependency Injection container: SimpleServices class coupled with [Service] attribute allows for simple class decoupling.

Other Utilities:
- Class which allows you to quickly create a tile-placing item once extended.
