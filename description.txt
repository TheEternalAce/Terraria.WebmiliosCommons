Webmilio's Commons Library adds a couple of things I use in all of my mods. You can extract the DLL from the Mod. 

Things this adds:
- Better Networking (in my opinion, at least).
- Full managers (singletons that handle classes that could be seen as static, but need inheritance)
- Identity Manager (WIP): a way to get Steam ID from the user (if the user is using Steam)
- A bunch of extensions
- Keyboard Manager: get the state of any keys (NotPressed, JustPressed, Pressed, JustReleased), regardless of Mod Hotkey.

If you want an example mod that uses this better networking, check out the JoJo mod by HellGoesOn on https://github.com/ruskies/TerrarianBizzareAdventure or https://github.com/ruskies/TLoZ and search for ModPlayerNetworkPacket.
